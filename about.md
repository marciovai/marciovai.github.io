Currently working remotely as Data Scientist from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil for an European startup based in Stockholm, Sweden. I've been working in IT for about 4 years in companies of different size and my favourite thing about IT jobs is having the opportunity to create things that are capable of causing an impact in human lives. Outside of work I usually work on my own pet projects and play video games.

This blog is a place for me to share ideas, knowledge and anything else I might find interesting for the world to see.
