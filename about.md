I have 4 years of experience working with Software Development and Machine Learning applications on both startups and big companies, from being an intern to mentoring others and being my own project manager, Iâ€™m always up for new challenges and interesting projects. 

Here you will find posts about ideas and projects that I've worked on, more on my [Github](https://github.com/marciovai) page.
