Currently working remotely as Data Scientist from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil for an European startup based in Stockholm, Sweden. I've been working in IT for about 5 years on startups and big companies and my favourite thing about my job is having the opportunity to create things capable of causing an impact in our lives. Outside of work I usually do my own pet projects and play video games.

This blog is a place for me to share ideas, knowledge and anything else I might find interesting for the world to see.
