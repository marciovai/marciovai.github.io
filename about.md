My name is Marcio Ribeiro, I'm 26 years old and currently live in São Paulo, Brazil. I began my career in IT working as a Software Developer back in 2016 creating custom ERP systems using Python, at the time I was already interested in Machine Learning and taking courses on the topic. After a couple of months I landed my first job on the field to work as Machine Learning Engineer for a startup focused on supply chain forecasting. Eventually I migrated to work as a Data Scientist and since then I have worked in a few different places.

What drew me to the field was all the applications being showcased at time using the technology, something that still amazes me to this day and keeps me going on my journing of constantly learning and improving. After gathering some experience in the area I'm looking for a big project to work on to bring a big impact as outcome.

This blog is a place for me to share ideas, knowledge and projects.
