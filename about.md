I'm a Data Scientist based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I've been working in IT for about 5 years on startups and big companies and my favourite thing about my job is having the opportunity to create things capable of causing an impact on a large scale. Outside of work I usually do my own pet projects and play video games.
